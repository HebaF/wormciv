# Worm Civilization: The Rise of Intelligence

This project simulates the evolution of *C. elegans* worms toward higher intelligence using multi-agent AI and evolutionary algorithms. Users, cast as a mad scientist, can guide worm evolution by adjusting genetic and neural parameters while observing emergent behaviors in a dynamic environment.
Data from the open-source OpenWorm project is used to simulate the real C. elegans connectome!
